- Contributed to ongoing research efforts at IIIT Naya Raipur, funded by the Ministry of Electronics and
  Information Technology, Government of India, by developing a FastAPI-based API to analyze plant images and provide
  accurate disease diagnosis results.
- In addition to developing the FastAPI-based API for plant disease diagnosis, I also worked on
  implementing Flutter support for the mobile application, allowing them to connect with database and remove few bugs.
